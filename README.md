# Predictive_maintainance in wind turbine
This project builds a predictive maintenance system for wind turbines using IoT sensors, condition monitoring, and real-time data analysis. By tracking key parameters such as vibration, temperature, rotor speed, and acoustic signals, the system identifies anomalies, predicts failures, and estimates the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of critical components like gearboxes, bearings, and blades.

The solution ensures early fault detection, minimizes unplanned downtime, optimizes maintenance schedules, lowers operational costs, and improves reliability and efficiency of wind energy systems driving a more sustainable and cost-effective renewable energy future.
